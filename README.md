This is a collection of manifests/deployments that are not something you'd use in an enterprise, but small homelabs you quickly tear down/back up. For example, a prometheus-operator deployment that out of the box grabs every ServieMonitor in the cluster. These are by no means best practice implementation, only the shortest path to having everything "up."
